# bdd-for-c

The `bdd-for-c` library is a [BDD][bdd] test framework for the [C language][c].


## Quick Start

To start, simply download the framework header file which can be easily done
with curl on Linux, MacOS, and BSD Unix:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grassator/bdd-for-c/master/bdd-for-c.h
```

Next, create a spec file, named something appropriate like `strncmp_spec.c` if
testing the `strncmp` function.  Add some tests and include the framework
header, like the following:

```c
#include <string.h>
#include "bdd-for-c.h"

spec("strncmp") {
    static const char *test_string = "foo";

    it("should return 0 when strings are equal") {
        check(strncmp(test_string, test_string, 12) == 0);
        check(strncmp(test_string, "foo", 12) == 0);
    }

    it("should work for empty strings") {
        check(strncmp("", "", 12) == 0);
    }

    it("should return non-0 when strings are not equal") {
        check(strncmp("foo", "bar", 12) != 0);
        check(strncmp("foo", "foobar", 12) != 0);
    }

    it("should return 0 when strings match up to specified length") {
        check(strncmp("foobar", "foobaz", 3) == 0);
    }
}
```

Assuming you have a C compiler like [Clang][clang] or [GCC][gcc] set up and
ready to go, just type in the following commands to compile and run the test:

```bash
cc strncmp_spec.c -o strncmp_spec
./strncmp_spec
```

You should then see test output similar to the following:

```
strncmp
  should return 0 when strings are equal (OK)
  should work for empty strings (OK)
  should return non-0 when strings are not equal (OK)
  should return 0 when strings match up to specified length (OK)
```


## Dependencies

On *nix systems, bdd-for-c depends on the following libraries:

* libncurses 5.x
* libbsd

On Ubuntu-like (Debian) distributions you can install them via:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libbsd-dev
```


## Project Motivation and Development Philosophy

In order for testing to be truly useful, it needs to be easy to set up and use,
but also scalable for large projects.  The tests should be very readable but,
ideally, have the same look-and-feel as the host language.  The framework's
test output should be easy to read for both humans and machines.  Finally, if
it's C, the framework should only rely on ANSI/ISO-C99 features.

Unfortunately, all of the existing frameworks inspected before starting this
project lack one or more of those requirements, with the most common problem
being BASIC-style `BEGIN` / `END` delimiters for a test, like in the [CSpec
framework][cspec].  The issue with `BEGIN` / `END` delimiters is not just that
it "doesn't look like C", but also that it imposes a different typing flow and
screws up auto-completion support for IDEs and programming text editors.

The bdd-for-c framework currently exclusively targets the model of "one spec,
one executable", as this model provides the fastest compile times (given a
correctly structured project).  This also makes mocking much easier.


## Handling State and Fixtures

If you need to set up some state once before all the tests, or before each of
the tests, `bdd-for-c` supports special `before` and `before_each` statements,
and their counterparts `after` and `after_each`.  As a bonus, you can define as
many `before`, `after`, `before_each` and `after_each` statements in any order
as you want, as long as they are on the same level as the corresponding `it`
statement.

> The only caveat with handling state is that, if you want to create some
> test-local variables, you need to mark them as `static`.  Otherwise, the
> changes done `before` and `before_each` will not persist to the test itself,
> as each of the tests and these setup / teardown functions are implemented as
> separate function calls.

Here's how it all fits together:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "bdd-for-c.h"

spec("some feature") {

    static int test_count;
    static int tests_failed;

    after() {
        printf("  All done!\n");
    }

    after() {
        printf("%i tests run. %i failed.\n", test_count, tests_failed);
    }

    before() {
        test_count = 0;
        tests_failed = 0;
    }

    before() {
        printf("  Starting the tests...\n\n");
    }

    before_each() {
        ++test_count;
        ++tests_failed;
    }

    after_each() {
        --tests_failed;
    }

    describe("broken math") {
        it("should not be equal") {
            check(3 + 2 != 6, "this is indeed broken!");
        }
    }

    context("when everything is right") {
        it("should work") {
            check(3 + 3 == 6);
        }
    }
}
```


## Output Colorization

By default, if the terminal correctly reports its color printing ability and
the application is run in the interactive mode (from terminal), then the output
is going to be colorized.

To disable this mode, simply add a define statement before you include the
`bdd-for-c.h` file:

```c
#define BDD_USE_COLOR 0
#include "bdd-for-c.h"
```

> Note to [CLion][clion] users: To get colored output when running tests from
> the IDE, you need to add `TERM=xterm-256color` to the `Environment Variables`
> field of your build configuration.


## Support for [TAP][tap]

The `bdd-for-c` library supports the [test anything protocol][tap], or TAP,
which formats output to be easily readable by programs.  This allows easier
integration with continuous integration systems as well as the aggregation of
output from multiple executables that use `bdd-for-c`.

To switch to TAP output mode you can add a `define` statement before including
the framework:

```c
#define BDD_USE_TAP 1
#include "bdd-for-c.h"
```

You may also add an environment variable when you run a test, instead:

```bash
BDD_USE_TAP=1 ./strncmp_spec
```


## Available Statements

The `bdd-for-c` framework uses macros to introduce several new statements to
the C language that are similar to the built-in statements, such as `if`.

These macros are implemented to be syntactically identical to the built-in
statements.  Among other things, this means that for the statements that expect
a body, the body can be empty (by terminating it with a semicolon), contain one
statement, or contain a code block (a list of statements):

```c
#include "bdd-for-c.h"

spec('statements') {
    it("should not do anything");
    it("should be in short form") check(1 + 1 == 2);
    it("should have a code block") {
        check(1 + 1 == 2);
    }
}
```

As with the built-in statements, you have to maintain a certain structure,
described where appropriate in the subsections below.

### spec

The `spec` statement must be a top-level statement and there must be exactly
one `spec` statement in the test executable.  Using more than one will result
in a compilation error.

Use `spec("some functionality")` to group a set of expectations and
setup/teardown code together, and to give the unit a name (in this case "some
functionality").  This will be used for test reporting.

### it

You must include `it` statements directly inside a `spec`, `describe`, or
`context` statement.  Each `it` statement expects a string argument, typically
starting with "should", used as a human readable explanation for the test, and
used in reporting: `it("should behave in some manner")`.

The `it` statement is a basic structural block of the spec and is used to
ensure a particular expectation, validated using `check` statements (described
below).

### fit / it_only

This is is similar to `it`, but switches test runner into a mode where it
will only run tests defined with `fit` / `it_only`.

### xit / it_skip

This is is similar to `it`, but skips this particular test. Unlike source
editing options of disabling the tests like commenting out or `if (0)`
you still get in an entry in the output with the name of the test marked
as `(SKIP)`.

### describe

A `describe` statement must be included directly inside a `spec` or `context`
statement, or within another `describe` statement.  It is used to group `it`
statements together, usually based on the fact that they belong to the same
unit of program functionality.

### context

A `context` statement is functionally identical to `describe`, and should be
used when it better conveys the topic of a group of tests.  It is usually used
to group `describe` statements based on the fact they depend on the same
program state, providing a way to easily set up the same program state for
several test conditions.

> NOTE: Because `context` is a quite common global variable in C applications,
> it is possible to not expose the `context` implementation in `bdd-for-c` by
> setting a flag before including the `bdd-for-c` library:

```c
#define BDD_NO_CONTEXT_KEYWORD 1
#include "bdd-for-c.h"
```

### check

A `check` statement is used to check "truthfulness" of a given expression.  In
case of failure, it terminates the current spec block and reports an error.
These statements must be placed inside of `it` statements, either as direct or
indirect children:

```c
#include "bdd-for-c.h"

spec("natural number") {
    it("should be non-negative") {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            check(i > 0);
        }
    }
}
```

By default, a `check` statement uses the provided expression for error
reporting, so, if you run the code above, you will see the following line:

```
Check failed: i > 0
```

Depending on your variable naming, as in this example, test output can be
unhelpful for figuring out the cause of the failure.  To remedy this problem,
you can provide a formatter and additional parameters in the same manner as
with `printf`:

```
check(i > 0, "a natural number %i must be greater than 0", i);
```

This can provide much more informative output:

```
Check failed: a natural number 0 must be greater than 0
```

> Due to limitations in the current implementation, the number of parameters to
> `check` is limited to 10.

While `check` statements are mostly useful inside of `it` statements, you can
use them in setup and teardown statements (`before`, `after`, `before_each`,
`after_each`) to validate some pre- or post-conditions as well.


### before

A `before` statement, if needed, can be included directly inside a `spec`,
`describe`, or `context` statement.  It runs once before all of the `it`
statements in the group/spec and can be useful to set up some state.  You can
use as many `before` statements as necessary.


### after

An `after` statement, if needed, can be included directly inside a `spec`,
`describe`, or `context` statement.  It runs once after all `it` statements in
the group and can be useful to tear down some state.  You can use as many
`after` statements as necessary.


### before_each

A `before_each` statement, if needed, can be included directly inside a `spec`,
`describe`, or `context` statement.  It runs before each `it` statement and can
be useful to set up some state.  You can use as many `before_each` statements
as necessary.


### after_each

An `after_each` statement, if needed, can be included directly inside a `spec`,
`describe`, or `context` statement.  It runs after each `it` statement and can
be useful to tear down some state.  You can use as many `after_each` statements
as necessary.
